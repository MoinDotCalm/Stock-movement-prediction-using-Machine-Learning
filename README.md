# Stock-movement-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The financial market is a dynamic and composite system where people can buy and sell currencies, stocks, equities and derivatives over virtual platforms supported by brokers. Stock markets are affected by many factors causing the uncertainty and high volatility in the market. Although humans can take orders and submit them to the market, automated trading systems (ATS) that are operated by the implementation of computer programs can perform better and with higher momentum in submitting orders than any human.  Since most of the dealings in the markets are done by automated systems, it has now been well established that training the past data can help us in finding patterns in the movement of the markets which can be used to predict the future prices. If implemented successfully with a higher accuracy than existing systems, it could turn into a financial support system with minimal amount of risk.  We will be using a Random Forest Classification algorithm as the dataset that we train is completely discrete and we will be using several indicators to calculate the data on which the training will be performed.
